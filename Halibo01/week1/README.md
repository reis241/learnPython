# This project is for my personal workspace.
In this project i will try new things using pytorch, sklearn and numpy.

1. Basic Installation: If you do not have an NVIDIA GPU or do not need GPU-specific dependencies, simply run:
```
pip install .
```
2. GPU Installation: If you have an NVIDIA GPU and have CUDA already installed on your system, you can install the GPU-specific dependencies by running:
```
pip install [gpu]
```

Once the installation is complete, you are ready to try out the provided code. Make sure your environment is set up correctly (e.g., CUDA drivers for GPU usage), and you're good to go!
